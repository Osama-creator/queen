# Motivation

As a Flutter developer most of the features you build in your apps is the same ,
so either you are building or copy and paste them in every single app , and this is BAD
there is not tests and no one to maintains this code after you deliver it !
queen come to solve this problem .

## is queen a Framework built on top of Another framework (Flutter) ?

the answer is no , queen is not a framework consider it as a collection of packages that works well together out of the box or just boilerplate for flutter apps ?

your app needs a `localization` , `validation` , `theming` , `utilities` , `loggings` , ...etc
queen have these solutions for you out of the box and they work together

for example form validation errors needs to be localized , queen does that out of the box and so one
to ensure you write the minimum amount of code and boost your productivity since localizing the errors is very common features in any app .

# The Goal

- **standard architecture between projects , simple and clean**
- **productive environment , queen will give you a lot of features for common use cases**
- **maintainable projects**
- **easy to use features out of the box**
- **take care of the redundant features which lets you focus more on the app requirements**
